Introduction
================================

Statsfiles is a small python module to compute simple statistics (average and means) of similarly named files. 
This can be usefull for simulations where a program outputs many files with the same name, but with a number appended. 

Warning: Bad Docs
-----------------
The documentation has only been started very recently. It is thus full of language errors, probably wrong at certain places and of poor quality.
However, the quality will increase overtime.
